- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tayaredhouse
- ðŸ‘€ I just finished the Codecademy pro career path for Front-End Engineer. 
- ðŸŒ± During my coursework, I learned the foundations of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Redux, and more! While I'm currently working in Customer Service, I found my passion and interest in front-end development. Think back to MySpace days! That's when I first started enjoying coding. I even made a few blog and anime websites (cringe lol). Now I'm trying to pursue that joy once again! 
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out for any collaborations or job prospects.
